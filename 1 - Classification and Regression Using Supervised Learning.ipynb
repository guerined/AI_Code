    "Unsupervised learning refers to the process of building a machine learning model without relying on labeled training data. Since there are no labels available, you need to extract insights based on just the data given to you. The tricky thing here is that we don't know exactly what the criteria of separation should be. Hence, an unsupervised learning algorithm needs to separate the given dataset into a number of groups in the best way possible."
