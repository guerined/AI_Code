Also, going through every single solution is not possible because it is prohibitively expensive. In such cases, we rely on a rule of thumb that helps narrow down the search by eliminating the options that are obviously wrong. This rule of thumb is called a heuristic. The method of using heuristics to guide our search is called heuristic search."

If the mew state is not better, then we make it the current state with a certain predefined probability. We do this using a random generator and making a decision based on a threshold.
